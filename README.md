flapping about in space - basic html5 game (first year university javascript project)

one-level html5 canvas flappy bird-esque game, needs work... 
needs substantial code shrinkage

there's also an issue with the space pigeon exploding even when it hasn't visibly hit anything - miles away from any rectangle.
could be an issue with old arrays of rectangles coming through again, invisibly apparently

rectangles need to be created randomly, while maintaining playability - vertical gap to fly through
always between 120/130px and 150px

needs:
finish line = next level
new levels
rectangles created randomly with much less code
