# spacePigeon

git clone git@github.com:jdm79/spacePigeon.git and open the html page in the browser. play Space Pigeon.

flapping about in space - basic html5 game (first year university javascript project)

one-level html5 canvas flappy bird-esque game, needs work... 
needs substantial code shrinkage

there's also an issue with the old layout where the space pigeon exploded even when it hadn't visibly hit anything - miles away from any rectangle. hidden now with new layout, but problem is still there.
could be an issue with old arrays of rectangles coming through again, invisibly apparently

rectangles need to be created randomly, while maintaining playability - vertical gap to fly through
always between 120/130px and 150px

needs:
finish line = next level
new levels
rectangles created randomly with much less code
